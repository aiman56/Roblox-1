## Model Design

Now, we're onto the next step: creating a model that matches our theme. With our theme in mind, we're going to design an object that fits perfectly into our game world

In ***Roblox***, a character is called a ***Model***. ***Model*** doesn't neccessarily means it is human or a living things. It can be inanimate things like a rock or a box. ***Model*** is composed of multiple parts that have been grouped together.


1. To create our own model, first we need to add mutliple parts to our game. To do this, go the ***View*** tab at the top of your screen and click Explorer.

</p>

1.  The  ***Explorer***  window will appear at the right side of your screen. Click the ***+*** button beside the ***Workspace*** and type ***Part*** into the search bar and choose it. Repeat this step 5 times until you have 5 parts in the ***Workspace***.

</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="..\Assets\drawing53.png" alt="drawing53"  width="400" style="border: 2px solid  gray;"/>
</p>

1. To combine all of the ***Parts***, you need to highlight all of the ***Parts*** that you have just created. To do this, click the top most ***Parts*** in the list and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> while simultaneously click the <kbd>&darr;</kbd> until the last ***Parts*** in the list 

<p align="center">
    <img src="..\Assets\drawing54.png" alt="drawing54"  width="400" style="border: 2px solid  gray;"/>
</p>

4. <kbd>Right Mouse Click</kbd> on any of the highlighted ***Parts*** and choose ***Group as a Model***. This will combine all of the ***Parts*** into one ***Model***.
    
<p align="center">
    <img src="..\Assets\drawing55.png" alt="drawing55"  width="400" style="border: 2px solid  gray;"/>
</p>

5. Now you can see that all of the ***Parts*** is under the ***Models***.

## Using Roblox Model

We've just crafted our own model, but guess what? Roblox also offers a bunch of ready-made models that we can use! These pre-made models can save us a ton of time and effort. With Roblox's library at our fingertips, we can choose from a wide variety of objects, characters, and environments that suit our game theme perfectly. By incorporating these ready-made models into our game, we can enhance its visuals and gameplay without starting from scratch. So, let's explore Roblox's collection and see how we can integrate these awesome models into our game to make it even better!

1. Go the ***Home*** tab and click ***Toolbox***.

<p align="center">
    <img src="..\Assets\drawing57.png" alt="drawing57"  width="400" style="border: 2px solid  gray;"/>
</p>

2. You'll find the ***Toolbox*** explorer on the left side of your screen. Make sure the filter is set to search for ***model***. This will help you quickly locate the models you need for your project.
