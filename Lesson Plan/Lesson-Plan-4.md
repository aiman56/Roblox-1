## Plannning the Project

### Game Design Documents

The initial phase of game development involves planning the game's design. It's essential to outline where the game will be played, who the characters are, and the actions they can perform.

Example game design documents are as below : 

| Component | Examples                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Setting   | - Haunted mansion. <br>- Deserted island. <br>- Space station.</br> |
| Main Character | - Adventurous archaeologist. <br>- Deep-sea diver. <br>- Resourceful scavenger.</br> |
| Actions | - Uncover ancient artifacts, decipher ancient texts. <br>- Explore underwater structures, interact with marine life. <br>- Search for supplies, fend off threats, rebuild society.</br> |


### Creating First Map Layout

Now that we've determined the settings, we can begin crafting the map for the game environment. This initial stage involves outlining the layout of the map, focusing on establishing basic structures and overall layout without creating into specifics details.


The tool we'll utilize for this phase is known as the ***Terrain Editor***. This versatile tool enables the creation of various environmental details to enhance the game world.

1. Open Roblox Studio and choose the ***Flat Terrain*** Project.

2. Look for the ***Home*** tab ot the top of your screen and click the ***Editor*** button

</p>

3. After you clicked the ***Editor*** button, a window on the left will appear. At the top, there is two options which is ***Create*** and ***Edit***. In this step, we want to choose ***Create***  and then click ***Generate***

</p>
<div class="page"/>

### Editing the Map Layout

</p>

3. Scroll down to the ***Brush Settings*** section. Choose the shape of the terrain addition that you want. As you can see, there are three options, sphere,cube and cylinder. In the example picture, cylinder is choosen but you are free to choose any shape that you like.

Don't worry if you are adding terrain where you don't want to. You can use keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> to undo the progress.
