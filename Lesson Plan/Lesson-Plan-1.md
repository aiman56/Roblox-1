# Roblox  1 : Intro to Roblox


This tutorial explains the basics of  [Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/setting-up-roblox-studio)  by building, playtesting, and publishing a simple platformer experience. Follow each section and learn how to:

-   Create the foundation of your platformer using one of Studio's bundled templates.
    
-   Navigate around the 3D viewport to see the environment from every angle.
    
-   Create platforms for players to traverse using Studio's primary building blocks.
    
-   Playtest and troubleshoot your experience.
    
-   Make your experience available for everyone on Roblox to play.


## Creating New Experience

[Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/setting-up-roblox-studio), a free application available on Windows and Mac, is the essential building tool for Roblox experiences.

With Studio open, create a new place by pressing  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>. Alternatively, click the  Baseplate  template under the  All Templates  tab.

The Baseplate template consists of a spawn location where player characters appear in the world when they enter the experience, as well as a wide open baseplate floor.

## Inserting Parts

A **Part** is Roblox's primary building block. You can **move**, **resize**, and **rotate** parts, as well as customize their appearance, such as their **color and material**. There are five different part types that you can insert through the Parts section of the **Home** or **Model** tabs

To insert a part :

1. In the menu bar, select **Model** tab.

## Selecting Parts

Inserted parts are automatically selected, and you can select parts at any time with the **Select** tool. Hovering over and clicking a part selects it, and you can select multiple parts by holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> as you hover over and click them.
